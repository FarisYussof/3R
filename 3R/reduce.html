<legend><h3>Solar Panel</h3></legend>
  <p>A solar panel is a photovoltaic panel designed to absorb the sun ray to produce electricity or heating
  Each solar panel has approximately sixty little squares. These squares are individual solar cells, which are linked together by wires.
  nside each individual solar cell is where the electricity is made; electricity is then carried by the wires to a junction box where the
   panel is hooked into a larger array. The amount of power a solar panel makes is based on the wattage of the solar panel.</p>

  <p>The higher the wattage of a solar panel the more electricity it produces because it has access to more solar irradiation.
The amount of electricity solar panels produce also depends on average sunlight over the course of a year. To know this you need to find
your place on the globe to see if your area is more cloudy, and therefore less available energy from the sun to convert into electricity.</p>

<p>Malaysia, for example, is a great place to produce solar energy. That is why the solar industry in Malaysia is expanding with several solar
   power companies and solar farms.</p>

   <h3>How many solar panels are needed to power an average house?</h3>
<p>The average house uses about 900 kWh per month. This is a lot and you can really save a big amount of money by using solar power.

So how do you calculate how many solar panels you need? Let’s take 900 kWh and divide by the amount of kWH one solar panel produces, that is around 30 kWh monthly. You will need 30 panels to produce 250 watts per panel to produce 7,500 kW.

Of course, before you install your solar panels, it’s recommended to consult a solar company. The expert will tell you how your solar power system should be depending on how much devices you use and your lifestyle, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Light Bulb uses 60 watts</li>
<li>Laptops use 45 watts</li>
<li>Desktops between 150-300 watts</li>
<li>Window air conditioning range between 500 and 1500 watts</li>
<li>Central air conditioning can use 3500 watts.</li>
</ul>

  <legend><h3>Why we need to use Solar Panel</h3></legend>
  <h4>1. Using Less Water</h4>
  <p>Water is one of our most precious natural resources. We live on the driest continent on the planet, and we run the risk of running out of fresh water in the future. Traditional electricity production can use thousands of litres of water each year. Water is used for cooling generators, processing and refining fuel and transporting fuel through pipes. Generating power through solar panels, however, uses no water whatsoever. The operation of solar photovoltaic cells doesn’t require water at all to generate electricity, reducing the strain on this precious resource. The only water needed is rainwater to naturally clean the panels when they get a bit grubby!</p>

  <h4>2. Reducing Air Pollution</h4>
  <p>The air we breathe can help or hinder our health and wellbeing. Electricity generation from fossil fuels can generate harmful carbon dioxide and methane gases that lower the quality of the air we breathe. Breathing poor quality air on a daily basis can have dire consequences for our health. Air pollution has been linked to asthma and allergies, bronchitis, pneumonia, headaches, anxiety, heart attacks and even some cancers. Using the sun to generate more and more of our power means less and less harmful emissions from burning fossil fuels. Generating electricity from solar panels produce no harmful emissions, and the more homes and businesses that rely on solar power means less toxic emissions from fossil fuels into our air.</p>

  <h4>3. Help to Slow Climate Change</h4>
  <p>The release of toxic gases into the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, doesn’t just contribute to air pollution, but also contributes to the enhanced greenhouse effect. While the greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth’s surface to a liveable temperature, human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. This has led to the enhanced greenhouse effect, which is warming our earth faster than ever before. In recent years, this has been linked to a number of catastrophic weather events, such as flooding, cyclones, storms, extreme heat and drought. Generating electricity from solar panels produce no greenhouse gases whatsoever, and so can help to reduce the effect of climate change if used widely.  With solar energy powering a home or business, there is no burning of fuel and no emissions from energy production.</p>
