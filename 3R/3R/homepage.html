      <p id="about">Today as we can see our world having issues, the climate change making us and other living things in ecosystem. This Earth has become a hotter plan than before. We need earth to survive, as a source of food and water to the air we breathe. Climate change happens when greenhouse effect occurs, it’s when Earth’s atmosphere traps the energy from the sun. The sun’s rays hit the Earth, some of these rays go back into space and some of these rays are absorbed and redistributed by greenhouse gases. Types of greenhouse gases include water vapour, methane, and nitrous oxide, but the most present greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide. Plus, pollutions is getting more common these days such as ocean litter, pesticides and fertilizers and air pollution. This pollutions are very cornering, hence people should take actions to prevent/reduce this pollutions from destroying our beloved Earth.</p>
