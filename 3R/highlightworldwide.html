     <h3>1) Wind Energy in Corpus Christi, Texas </h3><br>
Back in 2002, Texas deregulated its electricity market, which meant that
consumers could pick their own energy provider. That’s when Corpus Christi
decided to pave the way for wind power. The city is now home to the county’s
first on-port wind farm that ships wind turbines to all other states. By using
the power of all-natural wind, Texas now saves more than 8.1 billion gallons of
water and avoids 22 million metric tons of CO2 emissions each year.</p>

    <div class="box2"> <h3>2) Green building in Chicago</h3> <br>
As we’ve mentioned before, it literally takes a lot of energy to go to work. The EPA found that
commercial buildings in Chicago are responsible for 70 percent of the city’s carbon emissions.
But in an effort to reduce its carbon footprint, Chicago has a Green Permit Program that promotes,
expedites and reduces the cost of green architecture. In fact, the Windy City has the most LEED-certified
projects in the U.S. at 295.

     <h3>3) Alternative transportation in Portland, Ore.</h3> <br>
Light rail, streetcar, bus, biking, smart cars. If there’s one place you want to be without a
smog-emitting automobile, it’s probably Portland. Thanks to the Portland Bureau of Transportation
and the Bicycle Transportation Alliance, it’s one of the most bike-friendly cities in the country.

<h2>Sweden</h2>

    <div class="box4">

  <h3>1) District heating in Gothenburg</h3> <br>
Sweden’s shift from oil to district heating in the early 1990’s is perhaps the single most important
factor in explaining the country’s reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, both in the housing and
 service sector. Today, district heating accounts for more than 80 per cent of the heat and hot water
provided to Sweden’s apartment blocks. Centralising the way buildings are heated and cooled through a
main source means that the central plant can be advanced to use more sustainable and clean forms of fuel.
Many district heating networks also make use of recycled heat from industries – energy that would otherwise
go to waste. Gothenburg, Sweden’s second-largest city, boasts a a district heating network which is
1,200 kilometres long and heats 90 per cent of the city’s apartment blocks, along with 12,000
detached homes.</p>

    <div class="box5">
   <h3>2) Sustainability through urban farming all across Sweden</h3> <br>
Urban farming in allotment gardens has long been a popular pastime among Swedes, in many corners of
the country. Residents share a piece of land cultivated into gardens where they grow fruits and
vegetables. Koloniträdgårdförbundet (the Association of Allotment Gardens) oversees this initiative.
The 100 year-old organisation represents over 25,000 members and 260 member organisations,
including urban farmers and gardening collectives.</p>

  <h2>Iceland</h2>

    <div class="box6">

  <p>
Until the 1970s, Iceland was classified a developing country by the United Nations Development Programme.
For centuries it was among the poorest in Europe, a nation of subsistence farmers and fishermen with
85% of its electricity coming from imported coal. Today, almost 100% of Iceland’s electricity and
heat is generated from domestic renewable sources, mainly geothermal. Shifting from sending money
overseas for coal to paying local electricity providers has saved Iceland the net profit of half of
its GDP in 10 years.</p>

  Clean Transportation <br>
In the year 2030, the last diesel and gasoline powered car will have been sold, and in 2035 the last
plug-in hybrid will have had its time in the spotlight. All cars sold beyond that will be zero-emission
cars, and in their base form that means electric, no matter the origin of the electricity, as long as
no carbon is added to the atmosphere in the process. To kick-start the process, it is decided that in
2019 and 2020 there will be no tax on electric vehicles up to DKK 400,000 ($62,000 — though when you
account for import tariffs and VAT it reflects a US base price of $40,000).
The target is 1 million electric vehicles (including plug-in hybrids) on the Danish roads by 2030.
This is less radical than some other countries, but it’s just another government underlining the obvious:
The internal combustion engine is dying, fast.</p>
