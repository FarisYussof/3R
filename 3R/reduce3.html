      <legend><h2>Public Transportation</h2></legend>
      <p>Public transportation is a form of travel offered locally that enables more people to travel together along designated routes. Typical examples of forms of public transportation include buses, trains, and trams. High-speed rails, airlines, and coaches dominate public transportation between cities. Most public transport services operate on stipulated timelines. Some transportation systems operate on a full capacity basis, which means the vehicle will not start until itâ€™s full. However many cities across the world provide shared taxis when the essence of time is a factor.</p>

      <h3>Various Public Transportation Modes</h3>

      <h4>1. Bus</h4>
      <p>Bus transport is one of the oldest and most common modes of transportation aimed at facilitating movement of people within a city or to remote locations. It has the advantage of being affordable and convenient if there is no traffic. Long ago, buses were managed by individuals, but these days, there is an upsurge of bus services that are clean and efficient. In fact, most federal governments want all public transport buses to be sparkling clean, embrace the cashless models, be economical and produce fewer emissions by 2020. The bus services are also required to be accessible to people with disabilities.</p>

      <h4>2. Train</h4>
      <p>Train transportation is rapidly growing. This is evident by the sea of humanity lining up at railway stations to commute to and from work. Most governments are ramping up the growth of this mode of transportation by increasing the number of trains and upgrading existing ones in the busiest routes. These governments are stepping up their efforts because trains contribute immensely to the reduction of traffic congestion and keeping more cars out of roads. Specific aspects that are targeted include expansion of railway networks, excellent travel information, and installation of Internet in trains. These ambitious projects should make train transportation a lot more attractive to enable people to leave their cars at home.</p>

      <h3>Benefits of Public Transportation</h3>

      <h4>1.Reduces Congestion</h4>
      <p>Urban congestion is one of the greatest challenges of developed nations. Statistically, Australian cities incur a cumulative annual cost of $12.9 billion due to traffic congestion. If transport systems are not modernized in the near future, this cost could go up to $20 billion. The solution to this nightmare lies in the expansion of public transportation. For instance, a single railway can get rid of 1000 cars from the roads.</p>

      <h4>2. Enhances Productivity</h4>
      <p>Public transportation plays a significant role in enhancing opportunity and productivity by moving knowledge, labor, and skills between and within markets. In the modern globalized world, capital, labor, and enterprise search out for the most productive markets, promoting healthy competition and symbiotic economic growth. Investing in remarkable public transportation instigates a series of economic growth.</p>

      <h4>3. Reduces Carbon footprint</h4>
      <p>Public transportation offers an immediate alternative for individuals seeking to reduce their energy use and carbon footprints. This action far exceeds the benefits of other energy saving household activities, such as using energy efficient light bulbs or adjusting thermostats.</p>

      <h4>4. Prevents Global Warming</h4>
      <p>As the impacts of global warming become more apparent, world leaders are looking for ways to bring down these effects. One of the easiest sectors to deal with is the transportation, and this involves having fewer automobiles on the roads. Cars emit greenhouse gasses, which are responsible for global warming. By reducing the number of vehicles, the amount of greenhouse gas produced will not be enough to cause global warming.</p>
