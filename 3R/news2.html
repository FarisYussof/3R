    <h3>3R to protect and conserve environment</h3> <br>
    <div class="box1">
      <p>KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Plastics Manufacturers Association (MPMA) and Lotte Chemical Titan (M) Sdn Bhd joined hands to organise the reuse, reduce, recycle (3Rs) programme for students of SJK (C) Pa Yai, here, recently.

MPMA president Lim Kok Boon said the MPMA-Lotte Chemical Titan 3Rs Awareness Programme 2014 was set up to promote and create awareness of the 3R concept and how it can play an important role in the conservation and protection of the environment.

<br><br>Lim added that environmental practices such as the 3Rs will help reduce the amount of waste produced by the people.

“MPMA is committed towards creating awareness of 3R and anti-littering as it was evident that the responsibility lies with the public,” he said.

Lim called on students, teachers and parents to practice the 3R concept as it is very simple for all to practice for the sake of the environment.

MPMA Johor branch chairman Lim Chun Yow said that waste management is becoming a huge burden to the country.

<br><br>“According to information obtained from government agencies, Malaysians would produce more than 30,000 tonnes of garbage daily by 2020.

“In this context, Malaysians from all walks of life should strive to live in a clean and healthy environment where cities, townships and communities are built on the fundamentals of sustainability and green technology,” said Chun Yow.</p>
